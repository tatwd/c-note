# c-note

This is my note of learning _K&R: The C Programming Language, Second Edition_. And in this repos, the source code in `example` dir is under `C89`, another in `exercise` dir is under the `C99`, which means i have to compile example code by run:

``` bash
$ gcc main.c -srd=c89
``` 

and compile exerise code without parameters.

In addition, i use the _MinGW/GCC_ to compile my code and _VSCode_ editor to edit my code.
