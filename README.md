# c-note

This is my note of learning _K&R: The C Programming Language, Second Edition_. And in this repo, the source code in `example` dir is from the book and under **C89**, another in `exercise` dir is under the **C99**. So it means i have to compile the example code by running:

``` bash
$ gcc main.c -std=c89
``` 

and compile exerise code without parameters.

In addition, i use the _MinGW/GCC-6.3.0_ to compile my code and _VSCode-1.12.1_ editor to edit my code.
